The article covers the stages which the spectrometer application takes to process the signal acquired by a Schottky diode receiver of the spectrometer.

First, we discuss what the signal consists of.
Then, we uncover unpleasant nuances of the time-domain signal processing.
Finally, we combine the results to build the spectrum we present.
